THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (&quot;LICENSE&quot;) IS A LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU (EITHER A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL, OR SINGLE LEGAL ENTITY) AND AC6 SARL (&quot;Ac6&quot;) FOR THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE ACCOMPANYING THIS LICENSE. AC6 IS ONLY WILLING TO LICENSE THE SOFTWARE TO YOU ON CONDITION THAT YOU ACCEPT ALL OF THE TERMS IN THIS LICENSE. BY CLICKING &quot;I AGREE&quot; OR BY INSTALLING OR OTHERWISE USING OR COPYING THE SOFTWARE YOU INDICATE THAT YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE, AC6 IS UNWILLING TO LICENSE THE SOFTWARE TO YOU; DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, USE, OR COPY THE SOFTWARE.
&quot;Software&quot; means any software, firmware and data accompanying this License, any documentation supplied with it, and any Updates, in all cases relating to the Ac6 package of software development tools. The package includes the System Workbench for STM32 integrated development environment (IDE) with build tools, including compiler, assembler, linker, libraries and example code. For convenience, your package also includes, or allow you to download, Separate Files (defined below in Clause 6 and also referred to a “MCU Firmware”), but these are licensed under their own terms and not as part of the Software.
&quot;Seat&quot; means the authorization from Ac6, as evidenced in the sales order, delivery confirmation email and License Key issued to you by Ac6, to use and run certain components or features of the Software, only in the quantities and for the time periods stated therein, and (if applicable) only with the target devices, and only in the countries or geographic regions, specified therein. Some parts of the Software may be free to use without the need for a License Key and will be referred to in this license as “Free Use Software”; note that the other parts of this license agreement continue to apply to Free Use Software.
&quot;License Key&quot; means (i) an electronic numbered activation code issued to you by Ac6 to enable, (i) the normal use mode; or (ii) the evaluation mode, valid for a specific time period (&quot;Evaluation Only&quot;); that enables the use of specific features of the Software.
“Updates” means updates, patches and modifications to the Software Ac6 may agree to make available to you from time to time under the terms of this License.
1. LICENSE GRANTS.
(i) SOFTWARE: Ac6 hereby grants to you, subject to the terms and conditions of this License, a non-exclusive, worldwide, non-transferable license, only for the Seats, to use the Software, solely for the purposes of your internal development, testing and debugging of software applications (referred to in this License as &quot;Software Applications&quot;). You shall not modify or redistribute any of the Software except as may be permitted by clauses 1(ii)-1(iii) below.
(ii) LIBRARIES: In respect of any bundled Language Libraries and Helper Libraries (together &quot;Target Libraries&quot;) Ac6 hereby grants you additional non-exclusive, non-transferable licenses to; (a) incorporate and link the Language Libraries into or with Software Applications, provided that Software Applications contain substantial additional functionality; (b) incorporate and link the Helper Libraries into, or use them in, Software Applications; and (c) reproduce and distribute the Target Libraries, only in object code form, and only as part of Software Applications.
(iii) EXAMPLE CODE: In respect of any bundled example code (“Example Code”) Ac6 hereby grants you additional non-exclusive, non-transferable licenses to; (a) use, copy and (if supplied in source form) modify the Example Code, only for internal testing, evaluation, and development and testing of Software Applications; (b) incorporate, compile and link the Example Code and any modifications into Software Applications; (c) reproduce and distribute the Example Code, and any modifications, only in object code form, and only as part of Software Applications.
2. RESTRICTIONS ON USE OF THE SOFTWARE.
(i) SEATS, INSTALLATION AND LICENSE KEYS: Your use of some parts of the Software is limited to the specific number of Seats issued to you by Ac6. For each Seat, Ac6 will make a License Key available to you to enable use of the Software, or certain components or optional functionality in the Software, as applicable. You shall only install and use the Software and License Keys on computers, or virtual machines running on computers, which are owned by you (or which are in your exclusive possession under an equipment finance arrangement) and which are either; (i) located at your premises; or (ii) portable computers which shall remain in the possession and control of your employees when outside such premises. Each Seat and License Key shall be limited or locked to a single item of your personal computer hardware (also known as host ID) on which the Seat or License Key is initially installed, except where Ac6 may separately agree to authorize the transfer (also known as re-hosting) of such Seat or License Key to another host ID.
(ii) COPYING: You shall not use or copy the Software or License Keys except as expressly authorized in this License. You may make one additional copy of the delivered Software media or image for backup or archival purposes.
(iii) UPDATES AND UPGRADES: Upgrades and Updates replace the earlier releases of Software that you are upgrading or updating, and are not additional copies. When you upgrade or update the Software, the License Key for such new release replaces your existing License Key. Therefore, if you are receiving the Software as an Update or upgrade, you obtain no rights to, and shall not, install or use this Update or upgrade unless you have first ceased all use of, and deleted, your License Key for the version of the Software that you are updating or upgrading.
(iv) PERMITTED USERS: The Software and License Keys shall be used only by your employees, or by your bona fide sub-contractors for whose acts and omissions you hereby agree to be responsible to Ac6 to the same extent as those of your employees, and provided always that such sub-contractors; (i) work only onsite at your premises; (ii) are aware of the terms of this License; (iii) are contractually obligated to use the same only for your benefit, and (iv) agree to assign all their work product and any rights they create therein in the supply of such work to you. Only the single individual, company or other legal entity to whom Ac6 is supplying this License may use the Software and License Keys. You shall not allow third parties (including but not limited to any subsidiary, parent or affiliated companies, or offsite contractors you may have) to use the Software or License Keys unless Ac6 specifically agrees otherwise with you on a case by case basis.
(v) REMOTE USE: The Software and License Keys shall only be used onsite at your premises, except when used offsite by an employee (but not a sub-contractor) of yours, on a portable computer, in accordance with the &quot;SEATS, INSTALLATION AND LICENSE KEYS&quot; paragraph above, as part of his or her normal work activities, and only for your benefit.
(vi) MULTIPLE VERSIONS: The media on which the Software resides may contain more than one version of the Software, each of which is compatible with a different operating system (such as Microsoft Windows 7 and Ubuntu Linux). Each version may only be installed and used by you to the extent that you have valid Seats and License Keys from Ac6.
(vii) EVALUATION USE RESTRICTION: If your License Key is Evaluation Only, or the Software is identified as an evaluation version (collectively &quot;Evaluation Software&quot;), then notwithstanding anything else in this License, YOU AGREE TO USE THE SOFTWARE ONLY FOR EVALUATION PURPOSES, AND AC6 DOES NOT GRANT YOU ANY RIGHTS TO DISTRIBUTE OR SUB-LICENSE SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS UNDER THIS LICENSE. Evaluation Software can be upgraded to a full license by acquiring a full license from Ac6.
(vii) ACADEMIC OR EDUCATIONAL USE RESTRICTION: If you or your employer or institution paid academic or educational pricing for the Software, or the Software is identified as an academic or educational version, then notwithstanding anything else in this License, YOU AGREE TO USE THE SOFTWARE ONLY FOR ACADEMIC, NON-COMMERCIAL PURPOSES, AND AC6 DOES NOT GRANT YOU ANY RIGHTS TO DISTRIBUTE OR SUB-LICENSE SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS UNDER THIS LICENSE.
(ix) REVERSE ENGINEERING: Except to the extent that such activity is permitted by applicable law you shall not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble any of the Software. If the Software was provided to you in Europe you shall not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble any of the Software for the purposes of error correction. 
(x) RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER OF LICENSED RIGHTS: The rights granted to you under this agreement may not be assigned, sublicensed or otherwise transferred by you to any third party without the prior written consent of Ac6. You shall not rent or lease the Software, or share it with contractors or third parties.
(xi) COPYRIGHT AND RESERVATION OF RIGHTS: The Software is owned by Ac6 or its licensors and is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and international treaties. The Software is licensed not sold. You acquire no rights to the Software other than as expressly provided by this License. You shall not remove from the Software any copyright notice or other notice and shall ensure that any such notice is reproduced in any copies of the whole or any part of the Software made by you.
3. CONFIDENTIALITY.
You acknowledge that the Software, License Keys, and any benchmarking data and related information mentioned in Clause 2 contain trade secrets and confidential material, and you agree to maintain them in confidence and apply security measures no less stringent than the measures which you apply to protect your own like information, but not less than a reasonable degree of care, to prevent their unauthorized disclosure and use. Subject to any restrictions imposed by applicable law, the period of confidentiality shall be indefinite. You agree that you shall not use any such information other than in normal use of the Software under the licenses granted in this License.
4. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.
(i) YOU AGREE THAT THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED &quot;AS IS&quot;, AND THAT AC6 EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS OR OTHER TERMS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
(ii) YOU EXPRESSLY ASSUME ALL LIABILITIES AND RISKS, FOR USE OR OPERATION OF SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, APPLICATIONS DESIGNED OR INTENDED FOR MISSION CRITICAL APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS PACEMAKERS, WEAPONRY, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION, FACTORY CONTROL SYSTEMS, ETC. SHOULD THE SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
(i) TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL AC6 BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE WHETHER BASED ON A CLAIM UNDER CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF AC6 WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
(ii) Ac6 does not seek to limit or exclude liability for death or personal injury arising from AC6&apos;s negligence and because some jurisdictions do not permit the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages the above limitation relating to liability for consequential damages may not apply to you.
(iii) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THIS LICENSE, THE MAXIMUM LIABILITY OF AC6 TO YOU IN AGGREGATE FOR ALL CLAIMS MADE AGAINST AC6 IN CONTRACT TORT OR OTHERWISE UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS LICENSE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL OF SUMS PAID BY YOU TO AC6 (IF ANY) FOR THIS LICENSE.
6. THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.
(i) The Software is supplied with or allows to download, and uses, third party software or materials which are governed by their own separate license agreements (together &quot;Separate Files&quot;). This License does not apply to such Separate Files and they are not included in the term &quot;Software&quot; under this License. You agree to comply with all terms and conditions imposed on you in respect of such Separate Files (&quot;Third Party Terms&quot;).  Any provisions in this License which differ from Third Party Terms are offered by Ac6 alone and shall not supersede or modify any Third Party Terms. In addition to Third Party Terms, the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provisions in this License shall apply to all Software and Separate Files.
(ii) AC6 HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES EXPRESS OR IMPLIED FROM ANY THIRD PARTIES REGARDING ANY SEPARATE FILES, ANY THIRD PARTY MATERIALS INCLUDED IN THE SOFTWARE, ANY THIRD PARTY MATERIALS FROM WHICH THE SOFTWARE IS DERIVED (COLLECTIVELY &quot;OTHER CODE&quot;), AND THE USE OF ANY OR ALL THE OTHER CODE IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION) ANY WARRANTIES OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
(iii) NO THIRD PARTY LICENSORS OF OTHER CODE SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND WHETHER MADE UNDER CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHER LEGAL THEORY, ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE OTHER CODE OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED UNDER EITHER OR BOTH THIS LICENSE AND THE LEGAL TERMS APPLICABLE TO ANY SEPARATE FILES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
(iv) The Software includes materials supplied by third party device manufacturers for use with their relevant target devices. To the extent such materials are either (i) identified as such in the Software (for example in a &quot;Help About&quot; box or on-screen copyright message), or (ii) presented, in a standard installation, for selection by you at a path name or file name which contains the name of the relevant manufacturer or device, you agree to use such materials (if at all) only to develop applications for the relevant devices of that vendor.

10. GENERAL.
(i) This License is governed by the laws of France without regard to any principle of conflicts of law. Any dispute arising hereunder shall be resolved in the court of Nanterre, trial and ruling being in French, and the parties hereby agree that venue and jurisdiction for any related proceedings arising hereunder shall lie exclusively with such courts; provided, however, that each party may enforce its and its affiliates’ intellectual property rights in any court, and similar governing body, of competent jurisdiction, including but not limited to equitable relief. Except where Ac6 agrees otherwise in a written contract signed by you and Ac6, this is the only agreement between you and Ac6 relating to the Software and it may only be modified by written agreement between you and Ac6. Except as expressly agreed in writing, this License may not be modified by purchase orders, advertising or other representation by any person. If any clause or sentence in this License is held by a court of law to be illegal or unenforceable the remaining provisions of this License shall not be affected thereby. The failure by Ac6 to enforce any of the provisions of this License, unless waived in writing, shall not constitute a waiver of Ac6&apos;s rights to enforce such provision or any other provision of this License in the future.
(ii) At Ac6&apos;s request, you agree to check your computers for installations of the Software, copies of License Keys, contents of any license server log files, individual or concurrent usage of Seats, and any other information requested by Ac6 relating to Software installation, usage and License Key management, and to provide this information to Ac6. Ac6 will not make such a request more frequently than once per year, except as necessary where Ac6 believes, in good faith, that an additional check is needed (for example after re-hosting a License Key). You agree that auditors nominated by Ac6 may also perform such checking and reporting on behalf of Ac6 by prior appointment during your normal business hours on seven (7) days&apos; notice. Ac6 shall bear the auditors&apos; costs for that audit unless it reveals unlicensed usage in which case you shall promptly reimburse Ac6 for all reasonable costs and expenses, including professional fees, relating to such audit. Any information which is disclosed to Ac6 or such auditors during checking or audit shall be treated as your confidential information and shall only be used by Ac6 for license management, compliance and enforcement purposes.
(iii) The Software provided under this License may require an export and/or import license from one or more governmental/public authorities. You agree that you will only export, re-export, or import Licensed Software, or Separate Files, directly or indirectly, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. You will ensure that its distributors, re-sellers, and end users comply with this article. If there are any delays in obtaining any required import/export licenses and/or permits required to ship the Licensed Software, Ac6 shall be entitled to postpone shipment of the Licensed Software by a period equivalent to such delay. You shall submit, upon Ac6 request, an end-user statement within the time limit required by Ac6 and in the format advised by Ac6. If there is any delay in delivering the end-user statement, Ac6 is entitled to postpone accordingly the respective delivery(ies) by a period equivalent to the delay period caused by your failure or delay in providing the end-user statement..
